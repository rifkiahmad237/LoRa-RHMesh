## LoRa RHMesh

This repository is a place in which I include all projects for LoRa RHMesh development for my thesis. I provide all projects within the `projects` folder. All development are made by myself, yet it is made based upon many different projects scattered all over the internet.

I develop mainly on an ESP32 board, connected with a RFM95 LoRa Chip. It transmits on 915 MHz.

Feel free to use them, and contact me if you will!
